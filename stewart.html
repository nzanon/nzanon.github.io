    <h1>3-Legged Stewart Gough Platform</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platform">Stewart Gough Platforms</a>, or simply "Motion Platforms", are typically platforms with 6 actuators (legs), 
        that are fixed to hinges on a platform at 3 points. These actuators push and pull the platform, allowing it to rotate in various different directions. My project took
        out half of the legs and settled on 3. Instead of rotating a platform, my project uses pins to angle an object in the middle.

        This process was inspired by an orthopedic surgery Robot by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoUTy3WPiXY">Robossis</a>, a biomedical engineering company that
        created the first and only surgical robot for long bone fracture realignments. I had the pleasure of working with them during the Fall of 2021, through Rowan University's
        undergraduate Clinic program.
