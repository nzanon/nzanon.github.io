    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>
      Yeah, this website isn't the prettiest (yet). This website was created
      from the need to give a more visual demonstration of my skills beyond 
      a resume. Here you will find some of my projects; projects that I am 
      proud of, projects where I found room for self improvement, and projects
      where I began my journey into different areas of engineering.
